ERC20Burnable: Implements the core functionality of an ERC20 token with the addition of a burn function to destroy tokens.
Ownable: Allows only the owner of the contract to perform restricted actions like minting or burning tokens. The contract owner is determined by the Ownable contract and is set when the contract is deployed.
